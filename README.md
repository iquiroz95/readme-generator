Generate a README.md file using Node.js

As a new person introduced to Node. I want to create a README.md file using my terminal. 
i want travel to a directory and run a "node index.js" command and have my terminal ask me a series of questions. 
The user's answers will be data, used to make a readme.md file. The finished read me should contain contain the title the user has input into the terminal.
as well as a description of their project, installation, desired license, tests commands, contribution details and contact information. 
after user is done answering questions in their terminal, they will receive a message letting them know the file has been successfully generated. 
Now we can see the finshed README.file containing all the data the user just input into the terminal. 
Within in the terminal i can also view the readme.md file using "cat README.md"

I will need to install all necessary npm packages using the terminal.
